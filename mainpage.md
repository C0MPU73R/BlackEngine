# Blackcomb
Blackcomb is intended to be a game engine.

@attention Blackcomb is a work in progress and is still VERY incomplete.
Don't expect much out of it!

To learn more about Blackcomb's API, check out the [class list](annotated.html).

## Dependencies
Blackcomb relies on GLFW3 and GLM. Debian and Ubuntu users can
get these via `sudo apt upgrade && sudo apt install libglfw3-dev libglm-dev`.
