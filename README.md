# Blackcomb [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Sparkpin/blackcomb.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/PatchMixolydic/blackcomb)

Blackcomb is ostensibly a game engine. It is incredibly incomplete and not currently intened for public use.
I do not plan to continue working on it any time soon, but feel free to have a look around regardless.

## Dependencies
Blackcomb currently relies on GLFW and GLM.
