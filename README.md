# Blackcomb
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Sparkpin/blackcomb.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/Sparkpin/blackcomb)

Blackcomb is ostensibly a game engine. It is incredibly incomplete and not currently intened for public use.

Right now, the code is ill-documented. Documenting the engine is the next thing I
intend to work on.

Further documentation can be found at [blackcomb.sparkp.in](http://blackcomb.sparkp.in/).

## Dependencies
Blackcomb currently relies on GLFW and GLM.
