# Blackcomb
Blackcomb is ostensibly a game engine. It is incredibly incomplete and not currently intened for public use.

Right now, the code is ill-documented. Documenting the engine is the next thing I
intend to work on.

Further documentation can be found at (blackcomb.sparkp.in)[http://blackcomb.sparkp.in/].

## Dependencies
Blackcomb currently relies on GLAD, GLFW, and stb_image.h.

Some details about the location of these libraries can be configured by CMake.
The defaults are not guaranteed to be sane.
